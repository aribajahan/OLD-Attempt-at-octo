Sometimes, it's just good to be reminded about what to invest ourselves in. 


####INVEST.
not just in your passions, but honing your **skills**. 
not just in the relationships in your life currently, but to **new dynamics**. 
not just with your time, but with your **deliberate attention**. 
not just to being productive, but being **impactful**. 
not just to physical attributions, but to your **health and mental peace**. 
not just to being perseverant, but being **compassionate**. 
not just with money, but with **genuine support**. 
not just in giving a "piece of your mind", but in giving a **piece of your heart**.
